# Tours-App-React-project
This is a Tours app based on a ReactJs Project. I have use the concept of fetch API to fetch some tours data and have used many functionalities like UseState, useEffect, UseContext, Props, onClick, etc in this project. In this app, you can see the loading brief at the starting and you can also delete any tours from the list as you want.
